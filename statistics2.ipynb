    "Q1. The three measures of central tendency are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mean\n",
    "- Median\n",
    "- Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. The mean, median, and mode are all measures of central tendency used to summarize a dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mean: It is the average value of a dataset calculated by adding up all the values and dividing by the number of values.\n",
    "- Median: It is the middle value of a dataset when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order.\n",
    "- Mode: It is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are used to provide a single representative value that summarizes the center or typical value of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Measures of central tendency for the given height data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mean: \\( \\text{Mean} = \\frac{178 + 177 + \\ldots + 176.5}{15} \\)\n",
    "- Median: Middle value when the data is arranged in ascending order.\n",
    "- Mode: Most frequently occurring value(s) in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. To find the standard deviation for the given data, we use the formula for sample standard deviation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{n-1}} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\( x_i \\) are the individual data points, \\( \\bar{x} \\) is the sample mean, and \\( n \\) is the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation are used to describe the spread or variability of a dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Range: It is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.\n",
    "- Variance: It measures the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean.\n",
    "- Standard Deviation: It is the square root of the variance and provides a measure of the average deviation of each data point from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a dataset with a small standard deviation has data points that are close to the mean, indicating low variability, while a dataset with a large standard deviation has data points that are spread out from the mean, indicating high variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. A Venn diagram is a graphical representation of the relationships between sets. It uses circles to represent sets, with overlapping circles indicating the intersection of sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. For the given sets \\( A = \\{2,3,4,5,6,7\\} \\) and \\( B = \\{0,2,6,8,10\\} \\):\n",
    "\n",
    "(i) \\( A \\cap B \\): Intersection of sets A and B, i.e., common elements in both sets.\n",
    "(ii) \\( A \\cup B \\): Union of sets A and B, i.e., all unique elements from both sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Skewness in data refers to the asymmetry in its distribution. If a distribution is skewed, it means that the tail of the distribution is pulled towards one direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. If a data is right skewed, the median will be less than the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. Covariance measures the degree to which two variables change together. It can be positive, negative, or zero. Correlation, on the other hand, standardizes covariance by dividing it by the product of the standard deviations of the variables, resulting in a value between -1 and 1. Correlation indicates the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11. The formula for calculating the sample mean is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\text{Mean} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\( x_i \\) are the individual data points and \\( n \\) is the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example calculation: If we have a dataset \\( \\{3, 5, 7, 9, 11\\} \\), the mean would be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\text{Mean} = \\frac{3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11}{5} = \\frac{35}{5} = 7 \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Q12. For a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q13. Covariance measures the degree to which two variables change together, whereas correlation measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables and is scaled to a range between -1 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q14. Outliers can significantly affect measures of central tendency and dispersion:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Central Tendency: Outliers can heavily influence the mean, pulling it towards the extreme value. However, the median and mode are less affected by outliers.\n",
    "- Dispersion: Outliers can inflate measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation, making the spread of data appear larger than it actually is."
